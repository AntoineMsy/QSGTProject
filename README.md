# QSGTProject
This repository  holds the code for the project "Tensor Networks for Lattice Gauge Theories".
## Getting started
The bulk of the work is done in `base_notebook.ipynb`, relying on some functions defined in the files `mps_finite.py`, which implement the MPS restricted to the physical space, and `utils.py` which contains some useful functions for Hamiltonian creation and optimization.
"TEBD" files are an attempt to apply TEBD to the problem (based on code in Tensors.net) but for now it doesn't work.
